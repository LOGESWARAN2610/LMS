                    <p>There are several forms of harassment but all can be defined as any unwelcome action by any person, whether verbal or physical, on a single or repeated basis, which humiliates insults or degrades. “Unwelcome”, for the purposes of this policy, refers to any action which the harasser knows, or ought to reasonably know is not desired by the victim of the harassment.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, racial harassment is defined as any unwelcome comments, racist statements, slurs, jokes, graffiti or literature or pictures and posters which may intentionally or unintentionally offend another person.</p>
                    <p>Sexual harassment is any unwanted attention of a sexual nature such as remarks about appearance or personal life, offensive written or visual actions like graffiti or degrading pictures, physical contact of any kind, or sexual demands.</p>

                        <a href="#" name="bookmark30">Workplace Violence and Abuse</a>
                    </h2><p>Workplace violence can be defined as a threat or an act of aggression resulting in physical or psychological damage, pain or injury to a worker, which arises during the course of work.</p>
                    <p>Abuse can be verbal, psychological or sexual in nature. Verbal abuse is the use of unwelcome, embarrassing, offensive, threatening or degrading comments. Psychological abuse is an act which provokes fear or diminishes a person’s dignity or self-esteem. Finally, sexual abuse is any unwelcome verbal or physical advance or sexually explicit statement.</p>
                    <p>The organization has a zero tolerance limit with regards to harassment and violence. Employees or volunteers engaging in either harassing or violent activities will be subject to discipline, which may include termination of employment and possibly criminal charges.</p>
                    <h1>13 Dispute Resolution</h1>
                    <p>Regrettably, conflict can occur in any working environment. In an effort to resolve conflict in an expedient, yet fair manner, the organization recommends the following process for conflict or dispute resolution.</p>
                    <ul id="l11">
                        <li>
                            <p>Speak to the person you are having the dispute with. Many times disputes arise due to misunderstandings and miscommunications.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If speaking to the individual does not work, speak to the Managing Director. The MD will arrange a meeting between those involved in the dispute, to determine a resolution.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The resolution of the MD shall be binding on both parties of the dispute.</p>
